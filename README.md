# Machine-Learning-Project

The purpose of this project is to detect fake reviews in a Yelp dataset of New York City restaurants. Reviews have been identified as fake/genuine by a filtering algorithm applied by Yelp. This is a supervised learning task which involves the handling of imbalanced classes, and the implementation of binary classification methods.
